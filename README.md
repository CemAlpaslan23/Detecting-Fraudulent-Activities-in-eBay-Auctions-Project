# Detecting-Fraudulent-Activities-in-eBay-Auctions-Project

-Developed a machine learning-based fraud detection system for eBay auctions using Python and the Shill Bidding Dataset which includes features of the popular products for the eBay auctions.

-The purpose of the project was to observe and analyze the effect of the given attributes in the dataset of different biddings to detect the fraud in eBay auctions and try to build a machine learning model to classify fraudulent activities in an eBay auction.

-Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), including correlation analysis, data visualization, and feature engineering to identify patterns associated with fraudulent bidding behaviour.

-Conducted statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to evaluate the impact of bidding attributes on fraud classification.

-Applied data preprocessing techniques, including feature scaling and normalization, to improve model performance and ensure consistent feature representation.

-Implemented and compared multiple classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to detect fraudulent auction activities.

-Evaluated model performance using appropriate classification metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC).

-Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimise model performance and select the most effective classifier.
